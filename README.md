Roblox Project: Glass UI Library

This was a UI library I made on ROBLOX to make it easier for me to make a unified UI look that is also easily customizable and implemented.

To use, simply insert the code under Library_GlassUI into a ModuleScript, and place ModuleScript under ServerStorage in the game. To use
the library, simply require() the ModuleScript and then call the functions inside the library with the appropriate arguments.

## Menu Bar
User-interaction is based on scrolling on the frame and then clicking to select, instead of moving the mouse on top of a button. This allows for near-infinite customizability regarding the number of items in the menu bar and that all of the options would be formatted in a visually appealing way.

A lot of options:
